## Background
The topic of migrating to Mars is getting hot.Elon Musk's projects like SpaceX, Starlink,Mars migration program,etc.Each porject he have launched brings hope to human society. I am also very interesting on exlporing Universe. Mars perhape is our next destination to continute next human generations.
This project has two parts. First part is scraping news from 'https://redplanetscience.com ' and storing data in MongoDB and as a json file. Second part is also using scraping skill to retrieve weather data from another website. Then based on the dataset, I will perform some simple data analsis.
