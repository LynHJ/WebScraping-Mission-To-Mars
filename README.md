The rainfall pattern of Hawaii is quite clear. There are four times of heavy rain during a year (2016, 8, 23 ~ 2017, 8, 23). Most of the time, the amount of rainfall is below 25mm. If tourists can avoid traveling in specific months(Feb,May,Jul, and Oct, based on the photo above), they would have a great time in Hawaii.
